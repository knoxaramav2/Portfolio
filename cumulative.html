            <p>
            ISU has several classes that have taught me effective strategies for visualizing and planning systems with multiple approaches, especially in regards to showing others an understandable model of a design. I have learned strategies for refining these designs as well.
            Largely in formal and mathematical proofs, but it also comes organically from technical projects where this kind of problem solving is necessary.
            There have been classes that have touched on this with theoretical projects where non-local concerns had to be addressed.
            Most of the ethical lessons have been largely common sense (or common morality), but we have on occasion covered real-life instances of the past where ethics have been abused, largely in the form of negligence.
            </p>    
        </h3>
            <h3>CR2)</h3>
            <p>
            Group projects are fairly common. I have taken extra group project courses, and they tend to focus more on group interaction and responsibility than a particular study focus.
            These have largely seemed to be more in the theoretical projects, or in review of current events.
            We are largely taught this as expectations of a customer and our ability to fulfill those wishes, as well legal and viability constraints that must be considered on our discretion.
            </p>
            <h3>CR3)</h3>
                <p>Yes, often classes seem to expect that we either use new technologies that may or may not have been taught to us at that point, or even utilize certain programming aspects, such as an algorithm, data structure, or design pattern we had not previously been exposed to. Usually online resources such as StackOverflow or various tutorial sites are sufficient for quickly learning new tools to complete these tasks.
                </p>
                    <h3>CR4)</h3>
                <p>Largely, these make clear the very broad set of knowledge and tools that exist that we are never formally exposed to. Every company seems to be using some new tools, or a unique implementation of one. Looking at projects that people work on that aim to solve so many different kinds of problems, and in so many different ways, it’s very obvious that this is a field that requires constant learning so as not to fall behind of the rest of the industry.
                </p>
                    <h3>CR5)</h3>
                <p>One example of this currently is an independent study that i’ve taken. In this, I’m applying many of the skills I’ve developed since coming here to develop a programming language compiler. I’ve taken a risk in whether or not I would have the time to adequately complete the project within the semester.
                </p>
                    <h3>CR6)</h3>
                <p>I would studied much harder in early calculus and related courses. Additionally, I would started in software engineering rather than switch from computer engineering. I feel those two were my biggest mistakes that I would do over.
